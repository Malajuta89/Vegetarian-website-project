<h1 class="blue"> What being vegetariam mean </h1>

<p> Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter</p>
<p> Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. </p>
<p> Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. </p>
<p> Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference</p>
